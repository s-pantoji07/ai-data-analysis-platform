o truly test the robustness of your "Text-to-SQL" intent layer, you need datasets with varied data types (dates, currencies, categories) and slightly "messy" real-world structures.

Here are four high-quality Kaggle datasets that will test your system in different ways:

1. The "Business Intelligence" Test: Superstore Sales
This is a classic retail dataset. It is perfect for testing temporal (time-based) queries and hierarchical categories.

Why it's good: It has Order Date, Ship Date, Sales, Profit, and geographical data (State, City).

Test Query: "What was the total profit in the Technology category for the year 2017?"

Challenge: Can your engine parse the Year from a full date string like 2017-01-01?

2. The "Comparison" Test: Spotify Tracks Dataset
This dataset contains audio features for over 100,000 tracks across different genres.

Why it's good: It mixes very precise floats (danceability, energy) with strings (track_genre).

Test Query: "Find the top 5 most danceable pop songs with an energy score above 0.8."

Challenge: This tests multiple numeric filters and a multi-column ranking logic.

3. The "Human Resources" Test: IBM HR Analytics Attrition
A fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists to predict employee turnover.

Why it's good: It’s full of Categorical Booleans (Yes/No) and Ordinal data (Education level 1-5).

Test Query: "What is the average monthly income for employees who travel frequently vs. those who don't?"

Challenge: This tests if your engine can handle "Frequent" string matching and Group By logic on categorical fields.

4. The "Market" Test: Avocado Prices
A simple but effective dataset representing weekly 2018 retail scan data for national retail volume and price.

Why it's good: It has a very specific "Type" column (organic vs conventional) and price data.

Test Query: "What was the average price of organic avocados in Chicago during 2016?"

Challenge: This requires filtering on three columns simultaneously: type, region, and year
